![Elephant before a mountain](https://a-z-animals.com/media/2019/11/Elephant-male-1024x535.jpg)
*Majestic giant, gentle and grand,  
Beneath snow-capped peaks, across golden sand.  
With wisdom and memory old as the hills,  
Stride quiet and patient, nature’s strength and will.*

*From savannah wild to digital domain,  
We gather as learners, eager to gain.  
With Codeus we journey, new skills to excel,  
A quest for knowledge, together we dwell.*

**Nature and knowledge, unwritten and code,  
Paths intertwining along life’s road.  
Like elephants mighty, or bright screens aglow,  
We grow in the sunlight of all we know.**
